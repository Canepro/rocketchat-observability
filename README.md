## ‚ú® Highlights

- One command to run on Docker or Podman (rootless or rootful)
- Always-deploy demo overlay using ephemeral ports (no port conflicts)
- File-provider Traefik (no docker.sock), single edge for all apps
- Full observability: Rocket.Chat, MongoDB, Node Exporter, Traefik, and NATS
- Grafana pre-provisioning and curated dashboards

## Quick start (TL;DR)

1) Clone and prepare:
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Canepro/rocketchat-observability.git
cd rocketchat-observability
cp .env.example .env
```

2) Start demo (ephemeral ports, http):
```bash
make demo-up
make url   # prints effective Rocket.Chat and Grafana URLs
```

3) Open the URLs printed by `make url`.
- Grafana login: user `admin`, password from `.env` (default `rc-admin`).

To stop:
```bash
make down
```

## Engine-agnostic design

- Works with both Docker and Podman; the Makefile auto-detects the engine.
- No dependency on provider sockets (no docker.sock exposure).
- Rootless-friendly: the demo overlay binds Traefik to random free localhost ports.

## Files overview

- compose.yml, compose.database.yml, compose.monitoring.yml, compose.traefik.yml (base stack)
- compose.demo.yml (ephemeral ports for Traefik)
- compose.prod.yml (fixed 80/443, prod-like)
- compose.nats-exporter.yml (NATS exporter added)
- files/prometheus/prometheus.yml (scrape jobs)
- files/grafana/provisioning/... (datasource and dashboards provisioning)
- files/grafana/download-dashboards.sh (curated dashboards fetcher)
- files/traefik/dynamic.tmpl.yml ‚Üí rendered to files/traefik/dynamic.yml
- scripts/print-urls.sh (discover effective URLs)
- scripts/render-traefik-config.sh (templating for Traefik dynamic config)
- scripts/confirm.sh (safety prompt for destructive tasks)
- Makefile (unified UX across Docker/Podman, with cleanup and upgrade flows)

## Configuration (.env)

Adjust `.env` to your environment:
```dotenv
TRAEFIK_PROTOCOL=http          # use https in production
DOMAIN=localhost               # your domain for production
GRAFANA_DOMAIN=                # set to subdomain for production (e.g., grafana.example.com)
GRAFANA_PATH=/grafana          # keep a path in demo or when not using subdomain
ROOT_URL=http://localhost      # align with your access
LETSENCRYPT_ENABLED=           # set to true with https in production
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=             # your email for ACME
GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=rc-admin
```

## Modes

- Demo (always-deploy): ephemeral ports, http
  ```bash
  make demo-up
  make url
  ```
- Prod-like: 80/443, https, Let's Encrypt
  ```bash
  # In .env:
  # TRAEFIK_PROTOCOL=https
  # LETSENCRYPT_ENABLED=true
  # LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=you@example.com
  # DOMAIN=your.domain
  make prod-up
  ```

## Observability

Prometheus scrapes:
- Prometheus: http://prometheus:9090
- Node Exporter: http://node-exporter:9100
- MongoDB Exporter: http://mongodb-exporter:9216
- Rocket.Chat: http://rocketchat:9458
- Traefik: http://traefik:9096
- NATS Exporter: http://nats-exporter:7777

Grafana:
- Pre-provisioned Prometheus datasource
- Dashboards auto-downloaded: Prometheus overview, Node Exporter Full, Traefik v2, Rocket.Chat, NATS, MongoDB exporter
- Files: `files/grafana/provisioning/...`, dashboards under `files/grafana/dashboards/imported/...`

Update dashboards:
```bash
make fetch-dashboards
```

## Traefik routing

- Provider: file (no docker labels required).
- Dynamic config is templated from `.env`:
  - Host(`${DOMAIN}`) ‚Üí Rocket.Chat
  - Host(`${DOMAIN}`) && PathPrefix(`${GRAFANA_PATH}`) ‚Üí Grafana (path mode)
  - Host(`${GRAFANA_DOMAIN}`) ‚Üí Grafana (subdomain mode)

Render config:
```bash
make render-traefik
```

Note: Ensure your static Traefik configuration (compose.traefik.yml) defines entryPoints `web` and optionally `websecure`, and enables the file provider pointing to `files/traefik/dynamic.yml`.

## Resetting or completely cleaning a demo

Use these when you want to get back to a pristine "first run" state.

- Safe cleanup (keep data volumes):
  ```bash
  make down
  make clean
  ```
  This stops containers and removes generated files (e.g., rendered Traefik config, imported dashboards) but preserves MongoDB, Grafana, Prometheus data.

- Factory reset demo (delete demo volumes):
  ```bash
  make demo-reset
  ```
  You'll be prompted to type YES. This stops the demo stack and deletes associated volumes, then removes generated files. Next `make demo-up` will start a fresh, empty workspace.

- Aggressive cleanup (cover demo/prod overlays):
  ```bash
  make nuke
  ```
  Similar to `demo-reset` but runs down -v using both demo and prod overlays to ensure all project volumes are removed.

Tip: After a reset, run:
```bash
make bootstrap
make demo-up
make url
```

## Backing up and restoring Rocket.Chat data (MongoDB)

Always back up before upgrading.

- Create a compressed backup:
  ```bash
  make backup-mongo
  # => backups/mongo/mongo-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.archive.gz
  ```

- Restore from a backup:
  ```bash
  make restore-mongo FILE=backups/mongo-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.archive.gz
  ```
  This stops Rocket.Chat, restores MongoDB with --drop, then starts Rocket.Chat again.

Notes:
- If your MongoDB requires auth, adjust the Makefile or provide a proper URI; the demo setup is authless.
- Ensure sufficient disk space for the dump/restore.

## Upgrading Rocket.Chat

General approach:
1) Backup:
   ```bash
   make backup-mongo
   ```
2) Review Rocket.Chat release notes and ensure MongoDB compatibility for your target version.
3) Update the Rocket.Chat image tag used by your compose:
   - Preferred: set it in `.env` (e.g., ROCKETCHAT_IMAGE=rocketchat/rocket.chat:6.9.0) if your compose references it.
   - Or edit `compose.yml` to change the `image:` tag for the `rocketchat` service.
4) Pull and restart only Rocket.Chat:
   ```bash
   make upgrade-rc
   ```
5) Verify:
   - Watch logs until startup completes:
     ```bash
     make logs
     ```
   - Sign in to the workspace and confirm the version in Admin.
   - Ensure metrics (http://rocketchat:9458 inside the network) and key functions work.

Rollback plan:
- Revert the image tag (in `.env` or compose.yml) to the previous version.
- `make upgrade-rc` to pull and restart.
- If needed, `make restore-mongo FILE=...` to restore the pre-upgrade backup.

Best practices:
- Upgrade one major version at a time when required by Rocket.Chat's migration guide.
- Avoid upgrading during peak use; schedule downtime or use maintenance mode.
- Keep MongoDB within Rocket.Chat's supported version range for your target release.

## Common tasks

- Show merged config:
  ```bash
  make compose-config
  ```
- Tail logs:
  ```bash
  make logs
  ```
- See services:
  ```bash
  make ps
  ```

## Security notes (production)

- Use `TRAEFIK_PROTOCOL=https` and Let's Encrypt.
- Set secure Grafana admin password and consider SSO/integrations.
- Restrict Traefik dashboard (if enabled) and disable in public contexts.
- Harden MongoDB auth and network policies if deploying beyond lab/demo.
