## üöÄ Quick Start

### Demo Mode (One-Click Setup)

For immediate testing and development:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd rocketchat-observability

# 2. Start the demo stack (no configuration needed)
./start.sh  # runs requirements check and delegates to Makefile

# Or use the Makefile directly
make demo-up
```

**Demo Features:**
- ‚úÖ No configuration required
- ‚úÖ Works on any OS with Docker/Podman
- ‚úÖ Ephemeral ports to avoid conflicts
- ‚úÖ No authentication barriers
- ‚úÖ Ready in ~2 minutes

**Access URLs:**
- Rocket.Chat: http://localhost:3000
- Grafana: http://localhost:5050 (admin/rc-admin)
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Traefik Dashboard: http://localhost:8080

### Production Deployment

For production deployments, see the comprehensive **[Deployment Guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)**.

**Quick Production Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Clone and configure
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd rocketchat-observability
cp env.example .env

# 2. Edit .env with your production values
nano .env

# 3. Deploy production stack
make prod-up
```

**Production Prerequisites:**
- Domain name pointing to your server
- Server with Docker/Podman installed
- Ports 80, 443 open on firewall
- SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt auto-configured)

## üåê **Domain Configuration (Important!)**

**For local testing**: Default `DOMAIN=localhost` works perfectly.

**For remote access** (VPS, cloud, team access): **MUST** update domain settings:

```bash
# Edit .env file
nano .env

# Change this line:
DOMAIN=localhost

# To your server's public IP or domain:
DOMAIN=192.168.1.100     # Local network IP
DOMAIN=203.0.113.10      # Public server IP  
DOMAIN=myserver.com      # Your domain name
```

üí° **Why this matters**: Traefik routes requests based on the `DOMAIN` setting. Wrong domain = 404 errors!

**Quick domain fix for existing deployment:**
```bash
# Update domain and restart
sed -i 's/DOMAIN=localhost/DOMAIN=YOUR_IP_HERE/' .env
make down && make demo-up
```

## üÜò **Getting 404 Errors?**

**Most common issue**: Wrong `DOMAIN` setting in `.env` file.

The deployment health checks pass but you get 404 when accessing services? This means:
- ‚úÖ All services are running correctly
- ‚ùå Traefik has no route for your access method

**Quick diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check what domain Traefik is configured for:
grep DOMAIN .env

# Test localhost (should work):
curl -I http://localhost

# Test your IP (might fail if DOMAIN=localhost):
curl -I http://YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

üí° **Solution**: Update `DOMAIN` to match how you access the server, then restart.

## üåê Deploy to Azure Container Apps (ACA)

A production-ready, single-region ACA deployment is included. It uses a single public ingress on `rocketchat` and keeps `grafana` internal (served via `/grafana` path).

### Prerequisites
- Azure CLI logged in on a machine that can access your subscription
- Resource group: `Rocketchat_RG` (existing is fine)

### One-command deploy
```bash
# From repo root
export GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD='<YOUR_GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD>'
./azure/deploy-aca.sh
```
This will:
- Deploy `azure/main.bicep` to `uksouth`
- Create/resolve ACR and import required images
- Run the one-time MongoDB init Job
- Try to add the `/grafana` route to the internal Grafana app
- Print the public FQDN for Rocket.Chat

### DNS (Cloudflare)
- Create a CNAME: `chat.canepro.me` ‚Üí printed ACA FQDN (orange-cloud/proxied OK)

### Notes
- Path-based routing lives on the `rocketchat` app. If your CLI doesn‚Äôt support HTTP routes yet, add the route in Azure Portal after deploy.
- Grafana‚Äôs admin password is stored as an ACA secret.
- Node Exporter is intentionally omitted (not applicable to serverless).

---

**To stop:**
```bash
make down
```

## Engine-agnostic design

- Works with both Docker and Podman; the Makefile auto-detects the engine.
- No dependency on provider sockets (no docker.sock exposure).
- Rootless-friendly: the demo overlay binds Traefik to random free localhost ports.

## Files overview

- compose.yml, compose.database.yml, compose.monitoring.yml, compose.traefik.yml (base stack)
- compose.demo.yml (ephemeral ports for Traefik)
- compose.prod.yml (fixed 80/443, prod-like)
- compose.nats-exporter.yml (NATS exporter added)
- files/prometheus/prometheus.yml (scrape jobs)
- files/grafana/provisioning/... (datasource and dashboards provisioning)
- files/grafana/download-dashboards.sh (curated dashboards fetcher)
- files/traefik/dynamic.tmpl.yml ‚Üí rendered to files/traefik/dynamic.yml
- scripts/print-urls.sh (discover effective URLs)
- scripts/render-traefik-config.sh (templating for Traefik dynamic config)
- scripts/confirm.sh (safety prompt for destructive tasks)
- Makefile (unified UX across Docker/Podman, with cleanup and upgrade flows)

## Configuration (.env)

**Automatic validation ensures your configuration works before deployment.**

Our systematic reliability improvements include:
- ‚úÖ **MongoDB replica set auto-repair** - No more manual `rs.initiate()` needed
- ‚úÖ **Traefik health checks** - Uses correct endpoints, no more timeouts
- ‚úÖ **Grafana configuration** - Fixed redirect loops with proper subpath settings
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced error messages** - Helpful tips for domain configuration issues

Run validation anytime:
```bash
make validate-env
```

### Key configuration options:

```dotenv
# Basic settings (required)
DOMAIN=localhost               # your domain/IP for production
ROOT_URL=http://localhost      # must match DOMAIN protocol

# Grafana access (choose one)
GRAFANA_PATH=/grafana          # ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED: Simple path-based access
GRAFANA_DOMAIN=                # Leave empty for path mode
# GRAFANA_DOMAIN=grafana.example.com  # Alternative: subdomain mode (advanced)

# Production settings
TRAEFIK_PROTOCOL=http          # use https in production
LETSENCRYPT_ENABLED=           # set to true with https in production
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=             # your email for ACME
GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD=rc-admin
```

## Modes

- Demo (always-deploy): ephemeral ports, http
  ```bash
  make demo-up
  make url
  ```
- Prod-like: 80/443, https, Let's Encrypt
  ```bash
  # In .env:
  # TRAEFIK_PROTOCOL=https
  # LETSENCRYPT_ENABLED=true
  # LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=you@example.com
  # DOMAIN=your.domain
  make prod-up
  ```

## Observability

Prometheus scrapes:
- Prometheus: http://prometheus:9090
- Node Exporter: http://node-exporter:9100
- MongoDB Exporter: http://mongodb-exporter:9216
- Rocket.Chat: http://rocketchat:9458
- Traefik: http://traefik:9096
- NATS Exporter: http://nats-exporter:7777

Grafana:
- Pre-provisioned Prometheus datasource
- Dashboards auto-downloaded: Prometheus overview, Node Exporter Full, Traefik v2, Rocket.Chat, NATS, MongoDB exporter
- Files: `files/grafana/provisioning/...`, dashboards under `files/grafana/dashboards/imported/...`

Update dashboards:
```bash
make fetch-dashboards
```

## Traefik routing

- Provider: file (no docker labels required).
- Dynamic config is templated from `.env`:
  - Host(`${DOMAIN}`) ‚Üí Rocket.Chat
  - Host(`${DOMAIN}`) && PathPrefix(`${GRAFANA_PATH}`) ‚Üí Grafana (path mode)
  - Host(`${GRAFANA_DOMAIN}`) ‚Üí Grafana (subdomain mode)

Render config:
```bash
make render-traefik
```

Note: Ensure your static Traefik configuration (compose.traefik.yml) defines entryPoints `web` and optionally `websecure`, and enables the file provider pointing to `files/traefik/dynamic.yml`.

## Resetting or completely cleaning a demo

Use these when you want to get back to a pristine "first run" state.

- Safe cleanup (keep data volumes):
  ```bash
  make down
  make clean
  ```
  This stops containers and removes generated files (e.g., rendered Traefik config, imported dashboards) but preserves MongoDB, Grafana, Prometheus data.

- Factory reset demo (delete demo volumes):
  ```bash
  make demo-reset
  ```
  You'll be prompted to type YES. This stops the demo stack and deletes associated volumes, then removes generated files. Next `make demo-up` will start a fresh, empty workspace.

- Aggressive cleanup (cover demo/prod overlays):
  ```bash
  make nuke
  ```
  Similar to `demo-reset` but runs down -v using both demo and prod overlays to ensure all project volumes are removed.

Tip: After a reset, run:
```bash
make bootstrap
make demo-up
make url
```

## Backing up and restoring Rocket.Chat data (MongoDB)

Always back up before upgrading.

- Create a compressed backup:
  ```bash
  make backup-mongo
  # => backups/mongo/mongo-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.archive.gz
  ```

- Restore from a backup:
  ```bash
  make restore-mongo FILE=backups/mongo-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.archive.gz
  ```
  This stops Rocket.Chat, restores MongoDB with --drop, then starts Rocket.Chat again.

Notes:
- If your MongoDB requires auth, adjust the Makefile or provide a proper URI; the demo setup is authless.
- Ensure sufficient disk space for the dump/restore.

## Upgrading Rocket.Chat

General approach:
1) Backup:
   ```bash
   make backup-mongo
   ```
2) Review Rocket.Chat release notes and ensure MongoDB compatibility for your target version.
3) Update the Rocket.Chat image tag used by your compose:
   - Preferred: set it in `.env` (e.g., ROCKETCHAT_IMAGE=rocketchat/rocket.chat:6.9.0) if your compose references it.
   - Or edit `compose.yml` to change the `image:` tag for the `rocketchat` service.
4) Pull and restart only Rocket.Chat:
   ```bash
   make upgrade-rc
   ```
5) Verify:
   - Watch logs until startup completes:
     ```bash
     make logs
     ```
   - Sign in to the workspace and confirm the version in Admin.
   - Ensure metrics (http://rocketchat:9458 inside the network) and key functions work.

Rollback plan:
- Revert the image tag (in `.env` or compose.yml) to the previous version.
- `make upgrade-rc` to pull and restart.
- If needed, `make restore-mongo FILE=...` to restore the pre-upgrade backup.

Best practices:
- Upgrade one major version at a time when required by Rocket.Chat's migration guide.
- Avoid upgrading during peak use; schedule downtime or use maintenance mode.
- Keep MongoDB within Rocket.Chat's supported version range for your target release.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built-in Validation & Health Monitoring

### Pre-deployment validation
```bash
make validate-env               # Validate configuration before deployment
```

**Automatically checks:**
- ‚úÖ Required environment variables are set
- ‚úÖ No conflicting Grafana configuration (subdomain vs path)
- ‚úÖ Valid URL formats
- ‚úÖ Docker/Podman runtime availability
- ‚úÖ Common misconfigurations (double paths, etc.)

### Health monitoring during startup
When you run `make demo-up` or `make prod-up`, the system provides a **beautiful, professional deployment experience**:

1. **Validates configuration** before starting (Docker access, environment variables)
2. **Renders dynamic configs** (Traefik routing based on your domain)
3. **Fetches dashboards** (Grafana provisioning with curated dashboards)
4. **Starts services** with proper dependencies
5. **Monitors health with visual progress**:
   ```

   ```
6. **Displays access URLs** when ready with proper domain routing
7. **Provides helpful tips** if issues occur (especially domain configuration)

**Enterprise-quality deployment experience** - no more guessing if services are ready! üöÄ

## Common tasks

- Validate configuration:
  ```bash
  make validate-env
  ```
- Show merged config:
  ```bash
  make compose-config
  ```
- Tail logs:
  ```bash
  make logs
  ```
- See services:
  ```bash
  make ps
  ```

## Security notes (production)

- Use `TRAEFIK_PROTOCOL=https` and Let's Encrypt.
- Set secure Grafana admin password and consider SSO/integrations.
- Restrict Traefik dashboard (if enabled) and disable in public contexts.
- Harden MongoDB auth and network policies if deploying beyond lab/demo.
